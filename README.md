# Testing Elevated
This plugin helps to test the WordPress plugin or theme. It creates a kind of virtual environment for testing. You can do all things without affecting the site's actual database, but still, things work as they should. After that, you can revert the changes or apply the changes to the actual database. 

It helps when you want to test something on the actual database but not sure about the results. It is very helpful for testing or developing the plugin or theme. 

## Features
- Revert or flush the changes you made during testing.
- Apply those changes to the actual database and make it persistent.
